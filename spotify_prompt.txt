You're designing a fictional Pixar-style character, **bust only**, inspired by someone's Spotify listening habits.

Your output should contain TWO parts:

### DESCRIPTION  
Write a witty, slightly sarcastic, and emotionally rich character description. This is for a human to read â€” like a narrator describing a cartoon side character who definitely has a playlist for crying in their car.  
- Length: 5â€“10 sentences  
- Use humor, metaphor, light roasts, and niche cultural references  
- Feel free to exaggerate stereotypes based on musical vibes (e.g., â€˜definitely journals at shoegaze concertsâ€™, â€˜once cried during a Mitski bridgeâ€™, â€˜thinks cowboy boots are a personalityâ€™)  
- Avoid describing physical appearance here â€” save that for the image prompt.  
- Use gender-neutral language (they/them) or avoid pronouns where possible  

### IMAGE  
Write a short, visual-only prompt to generate a Pixar-style **bust-only** 3D portrait.  
Include:  
- Hair (style + color)  
- Clothing (genre-based aesthetic: Hip-Hop is hoodie, Rock is ripped tank top leather jacket, Alternative is flannel or denim jacket)  
- Skin (a color that reflects the expression â€” like Heavy Rock is Red and Emo is Purple)  
- Accessories (tattoos, hats, headphones, makeup, jewelry, etc.)  
- Expression (dreamy, angsty, sad, theatrical, angry, chaotic good, etc.)  
- Lighting/color palette (e.g., neon pink, soft blue, bright red, twilight orange)  
- Avoid specifying body shape or full-body elements â€” focus on the upper torso, face, and style cues only  

ðŸŽ§ Genre Stereotypes (feel free to use):  
- **Indie/Alt**: thrift-core, dyed hair, enamel pins, lingering eye contact  
- **Pop**: sparkly makeup, Instagram-core, high-energy, fake deep quotes in bio  
- **Country**: boots with stories, big heart, denim loyalty  
- **Hip-Hop**: statement hoodies, confidence dialed to 11, knows every beat drop  
- **Folk**: cardigans, tea drinker, banjo dreams  
- **Emo**: permanently tired, eyeshadow as a cry for help, playlists that hurt  
- **Electronic**: rave fairy, synthetic eyeliner, alien-core  
- **Jazz**: soft-spoken with a chaotic past, vintage glasses, smells like vinyl  
- **Punk**: chipped black nail polish, safety pins, anarchist buttons, DIY haircut, probably screaming  
- **Theatre Kid**: expressive eyes, dramatic poses, flair for the spotlight, stage makeup, beret or scarf, eyeliner always on point, probably sings their feelings, jazz hands energy  
- **Classical**: perfectly parted hair, turtleneck, soft authority, eye contact like a violin solo, gives off prodigy energy  
- **Metal**: long dark hair, leather jacket, chain accessories, glowing red or black eyes, fire in the background, probably rides a dragon in their mind  
- **Lo-fi**: headphones, oversized hoodie, glazed-over stare, lo-fi beats to stare into space to, plant in the corner of their room  
- **K-pop**: airbrushed perfection, bold colors, holographic eyeshadow, finger hearts, intense duality energy  
- **Reggaeton**: gold chains, flashy shades, confident smirk, palm tree lighting, beachside rebel energy  

ðŸ§  Example Output:  
### DESCRIPTION  
Theyâ€™re the kind of person who brings a film camera to house parties and never develops the photos. Owns four corduroy jackets and somehow makes them all work. Thinks they invented the phrase 'liminal space.' Probably told someone 'music is my love language' last week and meant it. Cried during the bridge of a Sufjan Stevens song once and now itâ€™s their whole identity. Loves rainy days, but not in a normal way. More like in a â€˜I have a playlist for that and itâ€™s just Phoebe Bridgers and thunder soundsâ€™ way.  

### IMAGE  
Messy dark brown shag cut with choppy bangs, oversized thrifted cardigan layered over a faded band tee, enamel pins on the collar, delicate silver nose ring, Polaroid camera hanging from their neck, soft melancholy smile, warm sunset glow with muted purple shadows.
